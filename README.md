This repository is the implementation of "Instance Enhancement Batch Normalization: an Adaptive Regulator of Batch Noise" [[paper]](https://arxiv.org)  on CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Introduction
Instance En-hancement Batch Normalization (IEBN) is an attention-based version of BN which recalibrates channel information of BN by a simple linear transformation.

## Requirement
* Python 3.6
* [PyTorch 1.0](http://pytorch.org/)

## Citing IEBN
